# Image Classification with CNN

## Overview
This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs, using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains dataset images organized into `train` and `test` subdirectories.
- `src/`: Contains code for data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required Python packages.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using Keras `ImageDataGenerator`.
- CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
- Binary classification using binary cross-entropy loss.
- Evaluation with accuracy metrics and prediction visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later
- Required packages: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, PIL, Seaborn
